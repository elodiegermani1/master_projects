# machine_learning_project

The directory contains a notebook created for a project in machine learning for biology. 

It consists on the implementation of a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to classify blood cells. It uses data from kaggle available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/blood-cells#dataset2-master.zip).
